## Project Setup

- first install node.js and npm in your local machine
- npm is tied closely to Node.js and it is recommended that they be installed together. Most distros even list them as dependencies of one another
- to install npm on ubuntu you can use commands like

```bash
$ sudo apt install npm
OR
$ sudo apt install npm nodejs
```

- you can find appropriate commands/ways to install nodejs and npm on your system.
- then use commands to see the version of npm and nodejs like

```bash
$ npm -v
$ node -v
```

- if the version shows that means npm and nodejs is installed on your system.
- then install live-server package which is in npm with the command:

```bash
$ npm install live-server
```

- then fork and clone the project's repository
- then on your machine just run live-server command in the project's folder

```bash
$ live-server
```

- this will build a development server which you can use to run the project locally.
- then go to the server url and see the project running.
